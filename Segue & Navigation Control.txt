Segue & Navigation Control

1. Used for navigating from one view to the another.
2. Any transition from from one ViewController to another.

NOTE:- Segue helps us transition in two ways -
	i. Transition through Navigation
	ii. Transition by Presenting Modally.


ViewController:-

1. Its basically a file which is capable to containing Model & the Controller.
2. Contains @IBAction which is responsible for handling actions by manipulation data (Model).
3. The interaction b/w View and Controller using ViewController.

Note:- 
1. The object of the ViewController is accessed by the storyboard.
2. The code for the ViewConroller is managed and updated in ViewController.swift file.
3. Any UIElement will be created when the viewDidLoad() method gets called.
4. The code managed in ViewController.swift file, ViewController object is created and it puts element in the View,
5. Each ViewController has it's own View.
6. The launch screen is the splash screen visible to the user for the fraction of second while app opens.
7. The object of the ViewController is called in the UIViewController which is the part of the UIKit.
8. Triggered Segue - Change the view based on the triggered action (maybe a button click).

Options in the Segue -

i.  Show (default) 				 -> Present Modally
ii. Show (Navigation Controller) -> Navigation


Unwinding from a Segue :-
-> Helps us implement the returned method in the view controller you wish to return to.
-> Does not need anythoing but the following code :-
	@IBAction func myUnwindFunction(unwindSegue: UIStoryboardSegue) { ... }

Navigation using NavigationController :-
-> Need to add a  NavigationController class and manage the screens.
-> We need to also add the root view controller.


Passing Info using Segue 
-> Segue Properties :
	-> identifier
	-> destination

-> We do it using prepare() function where I get the access to the source & destination. 


Programattic Segue :-
Syntax = performSegue(withIdentifier:, sender:)
Call = performSegue(withIdentifier: "green"/"red", sender: nil)




VIEW CONTROLLER LIFE CYCLE :-


1. viewDidLoad 		:- 		All the object and property initialisations are done here. We can have memory initialisations are done here.
2. viewWillAppear	:-		
3. viewDidAppear	:- 


When you switch between View Controllers :-

VIEW - 1										VIEW - 2

viewDidLoad()
viewWillAppear()
viewDidAppear()
												viewDidLoad()
viewWillDisappear()
												viewWillAppear()
viewDidDisappear()
												viewDidAppear()
